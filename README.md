# Model-Predictiive-Control--MPC-
Frequency Control in a power system 

Abstract— A constrained dual-mode Linear Quadratic Model Predictive Control (LQ-MPC) was designed to adjust the reference power, 〖∆p〗^ref in response to frequency deviation and meet the desired specification. Relevant MPC parameters were evaluated to ensure guaranteed stability and recursive feasibility.
